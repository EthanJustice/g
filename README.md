# g

a small generative art language

`g` is non-functional at this point, and will most likely be renamed in the future.

See [design-drafts](./docs/content/design-drafts.md) for drafts of the language (which will most likely be changed significantly).

`g` is going to target web browsers and be compiled into JavaScript. The plan is to allow for interfacing between `g` and JavaScript, and allow the end target to be heavily customisable (themes, etc).

The language is going to be focused towards beginners and those new to programming.
